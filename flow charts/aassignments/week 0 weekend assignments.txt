1.sum of 1 to 10 numbers

step1: start
step2: declare count,sum
step3: Assigning the value 1 into count and assigning value '0' to sum
step4: adding count value to sum and store that result into sum (sum-->sum+count)
step5: increment the count value by 1 (count-->count+1)
step6: repeat these step 4 and step 5 until it reaches the count value lessthan or equal to 10
       (count<=10) otherwise go to step7
step7: print sum
step8: stop


2.print the even numbers from 1 to 100

step1:start
step2:declare  a variable n
step3:read the value of the variable n (n=1)
step4:if the value of the n is divisible by 2 and remains the value 0 (n%2==0) 
step5:print n is an even number
step6:increment n (n=n+1) 
step7:repeat step4 and step5 until n<=100
step8:stop


3.print the odd numbers from 1 to 100

step1:start
step2:declare a variable n
step3:read the value of the variable n (n=1)
step4:if the value of the variable n is divisible by 2 and reamins the value 1(n%2!=0)
step5:print n is an odd number
step6:increment n (n=n+1)
step7:repeat step4 and step5 until n is less than or equal to 100 (n<=100)
step8:stop
