write an algorithm to print sum of  1 to 20 even numbers 

step1:start
step2:declare count,sum
step3:assign the value of the count to 1 and sum to 0
step4:if the value of the count is divisible by 2 and leaves the remainder 0 go to step5 otherwise go to step 6
step5:add the count value to the sum add store the value into the sum (sum=count+sum)
step6:increment the count value by 1 (count=count+1)
step7:repeat step4 until the condition count reaches lessthan or equal to 20
step8:print sum
step9:stop
