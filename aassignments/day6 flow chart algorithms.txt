WAP to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross     salary according to following:
    Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
    Basic Salary <= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
    Basic Salary > 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%

step1: start
step2: decalre the variable basic salary, gross salary,HRA,DA
step3: read the basic salary
step4: if the basic salary was less than or equal to 10000
step5: calculate the 20%HRA(basic salary*20/100) and 80%	DA( basic salary*80/100)
step6: for calculating gross salary add basic salary+HRA+DA 	and store the result in gross salary then go to step13
step7: else if basic salary was less than or equal to 20000
step8:calculate the 25%HRA(basic salary*25/100) and 90%	DA( basic salary*90/100) 
step9: for calculating the gross salary add basic 	salary+HRA+DA  and store in gross salary then go to 	step13
step10:else if basic salary was greater than 20000
step 11:calculate the 30%HRA(basic salary*30/100) and 95%	DA( basic salary*95/100) 
step12: for calculating gross salary add basic salary+HRA+DA 	then store the result in gross salary andthen go to 	step13

step5: if BMI is less than or equal to 18.5
step6: print the person is under weight
step7: else if the BMI is less than or equal to 24.9
step8: print the person is normal weight
