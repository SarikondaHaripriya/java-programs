multiplication algorithm


step1:start
step2:intialise variable n amd m
step3:read the value of m to 1
step4:multiply m with n and store the result into n (n=n*m)
step5:increment m by 1 (m=m+1)
step6:repeat steps 4 and 5 until m<=10
step7:print m
step8:stop


step1:start
step2:declare i,n,res
step3:assign i=2,n=1
step4:check n<=10 is true goto step5 otherwise go to step9
step5:calculate i*n=res
step6:print res
step7:increment n value by 1(n=n+1)
step8:repeat the step4,5,6,7 untill it reaches n<=10
step9:stop
